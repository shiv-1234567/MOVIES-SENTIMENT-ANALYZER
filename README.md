IN THIS REPO I HAVE CREATED A MOVIES SENTIMENT ANALYZER WHICH WILL TAKE USER INPUT IN FROM OF TEXT & THEN USING MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BASE IT PREDICT THE OUTPUT, THERE IS NO APP BUT ONLY THE
CODE USING WHICH OUR MODEL WILL TELL SENTIMENT IS POSTIVE OR NEGATIVE.

STEPS DONE IN THIS MODEL;
1ST TEXT PREPROCESSING
IN WHICH I HAVE REMOVED HTML TAGS ,SPECIAL CHARACTERS,,STOP WORDS,AND STEMMING WORDS.
2ND 
TRAINED DIFFERENT ALGORITHM ON THE DATA TRANFORMED FIRST CREATED TRANING DATA , & TEST DATA THEN USED GAUSSIAN NB ,MULTINOMIAL NB , BERNOULLI NB .LOGISTIC REGRESSION ,
RANDOM FOREST OF WHICH RANDOM FORSET & MULTINOMAIL NB PERFORMED BEST.
TEHN MADE PREDICTION USING  ROWS OF X_TRAIN & GOT GOOD RESULT.
THIS MODEL WAS ALSO DEMONSTATION OF HOW TO TACKLE TEXTUAL DATA .


NOTE;AS DATASET FILE WAS VERY BIG HENCE UPLOADED A PKL FILE OF TRANFORMED DATA AFTER ALL CLEANING.
